# Resource monitor 

A lightweight real-time system resource monitoring tool for Linux, focused on observing and managing core system metrics directly from the kernel interfaces  shows usage and stats of :
-  CPU (per-core usage)
-  RAM & Swap memory
-  Disk usage
-  Network traffic (upload/download speeds)
-  Running processes (PID, memory usage, command)
-  Process control (kill switch)


> [!NOTE]
> ## Current State of the Project
> Core monitoring and process management functionalities are fully implemented, a complete interactive user interface is currently under development.
